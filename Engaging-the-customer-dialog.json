The Johor-grown D175 Red Prawn was more brown, with a greenish base to the thorns(and not as grey/brown as when it’s grown in Penang).\n\nThe spikes were clearly different — D13 was more blocky, with hard flat sides to each pyramidal spine, while the Red Prawn spines were smaller and had sharper little tips. Although the thorns became teenier and teenier and they reached the apex, the whole fruit had thorns on it — no bald spot.\n\nThe D13 at first glance seemed almost as pointy as the Red Prawn, but it actually had a small flat spot on the bottom that made it easier to stand the durian upright, unlike the D175 Red Prawn which kept tipping over."
